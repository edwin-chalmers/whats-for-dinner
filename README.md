# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <I built a website that allows the user to generate a random food item based off the category they select. This site will dynamically respond to the user's screen size, as well as play an animation when the user hovers over the LET's COOK! button.> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <The user needs to fork the repository and clone to their local machine. Open in word editor of their choice and launch website from there.> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### Preview of App:
[//]: <.assets/hover-rainbow.gif> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <This is the third project of mod1. I spent about 20 hours working on it before deciing to leave it as it is.> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

### Contributors:
[//]: <https://github.com/edwin-chalmers> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <The learning goals of this project were to build a website from scratch, as well as incorperate techniques one has reserched.> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <The intermediate CSS was fun but challenging. My wins are that I got the hover animation and responsive screen size to work well. It took a lot of trial and error to get my horizontally designed elements to look good when they became vertically aligned.> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
